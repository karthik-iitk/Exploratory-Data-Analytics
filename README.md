# Exploratory-Data-Analytics

PROBLEM STATEMENT & OBJECTIVE:

•Introduction
This data set is amasked data setwhich is similar to what data analysts at Uber handle. Solving this assignment gave me an idea about how problems are systematically solved using EDA and data visualisation.

•Business Objectives
The aim of analysis is to identify the root cause of the problem (i.e. cancellation and non-availability of cars) and recommend ways to improve the situation. As a result of this analysis, i was able to present to the evaluater the root cause(s) and possible hypotheses of the problem(s) and recommend ways to improve them.
